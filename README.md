**ROSEBURTON/ROSEBURTON** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...a chat bot called Study AI
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...natural language processing(NLP)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...creating a chat bot

- âš¡ Fun fact: ...I have a voice chat bot so instead of typing I can naturally speak like a human conversation
--> As someone deeply passionate about data science, I constantly seek ways to enhance my knowledge and skills in this field. That's why I created Study AI, a tool that helps me reinforce my understanding and retention of data science concepts by quizzing me on key terminologies and automatically browsing various online resources.

I am also a proud owner of a pet robot named Vector and I have created my own AI companion, Cognition. To stay up-to-date with the latest developments in data science, I often take courses on LinkedIn Learning and explore other data science-related resources. I am excited to continue my growth and development in this field and contribute my skills to meaningful projects and collaborations.
